Project Title: "Mining Iowa Liquor Sales"

Team Members: Nicholas Stafford, Alexander Sueppel, Alex Thomas, Kevin Vick (Group #4)

Description:
Alcohol sales throughout the state of Iowa were examined within the timeframe from January 1, 2012 to present. Long-term trends, such as preferences for certain brands, volumes, and varieties of liquors (e.g. vodka, gin, etc.), as well as shorter, seasonal trends (e.g. an increase in rum sales in the summer months) were of particular interest.
Further, geographic differences in preferences in Iowa, such as what liquor varieties and brands are popular in college towns throughout the state, are other interesting questions explored in this study.

Questions & Answers (Summary):
Trend Analysis
What dates were alcohol sales at their highest? December
What is the most common alcohol volume bought? 750ml
Which countries made up the majority of sales? Polk, Linn, Johnson, Scott, Blackhawk

Classification 
Can the dataset be used to accurately predict whether an alcohol sale takes place within the vicinity of a university? In short, no. The dataset is not ideal for this type of prediction.

Clustering 
How can the interaction between liquor sales and volume sold be grouped? Sales and volume can be grouped using K-Means with four clusters.
What categories of liquor have similar gross margins? Liquors from related geographies and similar purities had the most similar margins.

Outlier Analysis
How is data distributed? Not a normal distribution. Most numerical attributes are heavily skewed to low values with significant high-value outliers. Removing outliers normalizes the distribution.
Are there outliers and how many? Yes, over 60k by IQR method (highest) in a sample size of 1,000,000 (=6.7% of dataset contains outliers).
